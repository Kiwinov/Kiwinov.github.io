I am an engineering undergrad from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. 

I love solving difficult problems, especially technical ones. Working in deep-tech startups genuinely excites me for the same reason. 
My interest in math and machine learning drives my career choices of late. 

Previously, I had been engaged as a Student Researcher in the intersection of AI and HCI at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) in Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I also worked in an early stage deep-tech startup, [Dirac Labs](https://diraclabs.com) for almost an entire year, taking up various responsibilities including ML Engineering, Research and Founder's Office Operations.

I am also an Emergent Ventures grantee (EV India Cohort 10/11).
